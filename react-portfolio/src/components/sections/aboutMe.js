             <h2>About Me</h2>
             <p>I'm a proud father and husband, looking to learn new skills and acheive my goal of becoming a web developer. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am fascinated by the power of these technologies when combined together. As someone who is very new to web development but with a background of hands-on, blue collar work, I hope to one day be able to develop technologies that can improve and enhance the working lives of regular folk like me.</p>
